A basic game in ALlegro-5.0. You can open the files with XCode but to make this work you need to have the Allgero-5.0 library installed and XCode header paths set up respectively and other minor changes, you can check up about setting up XCode on their forums.
If you are using any other IDE then you need to check the specific setting for that IDE as well, if any.

What features added to the game?

1. I have provided a sprite sheet for convinience.
2. Added code to cut the sprite into diffrent BITMAP arrays and store them.
3. Made the animate class with basic walking functions.
4  Added code to get input and do the corresponding action.
